# Organizing-Deakin-Stuff-Automation
### This is a collection of Python Scripts that I use to keep deakin's assignments stuff organized
### Files:
- deadline.py: I personally hate the OnTrack Portal for not showing the deadlines easily, so many clicks. Solved the problem by creating my own Google Sheet Tracker for assignment deadlines.
- folder.py: As per my preference, having a separate folder for each of my tasks with separate files and work is convenient.

More coming soon, for portfolio report and all.
